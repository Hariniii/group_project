		<h4>Smart Watering System</h4>
		<img src="img/watering.jpg">
		<p style="font-size: 20px;"> In a country where farming was once considered the main occupation of the subjects, we identified that the technology used in the field needs to be improved more. The Sri Lankans tend to be rooted with the traditional methods of cultivation specially, in terms of watering. The unawareness of the humidity level and the moisture level of the soil causes the watering level, so we thought of a method to measure these parameters and water the plants acording to that measurements. Because of this method the plant gets the right amount that the plant requires and sometimes it will reduce the wastage of the water resource. So, the need of a smart watering system is thoughrly required and through this website it facilitates that need.

		<h4> Buying and Selling System</h4>
		<img src="img/buying.jpg">
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">One of a main problem in Sri Lanka is farmers are unable to sell their harvest at a fairly good price. Most of the times when the a surplus is created they are unable to sell the harvest at a fair prize and it is wasted due to the inability to find buyers. Sometimes they have to travel far to make deals. So, in most times farmers are unable to make a profit as the market doesn't give a good price to their harvest and they spend a lot to take that harvest. So, the need of a solution to this problem is required as if not, the farming industry in Sri Lanka will be fallen down. So, we decided to maka a platform to do the buying and delling process, so that the farmers can find buyers through online and can pre-decide the amount of harvest that they're going to pick up at a certain time period. At the other side buyers can meet sellers and order what they really needed through the website. But through our website we only hope to meet these group of people, the business should be continued by them afterwards.</p>
